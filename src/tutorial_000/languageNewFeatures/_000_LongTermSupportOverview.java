	 * Understand the new java's releases cycle and Oracle Long Term Support is really important for any java developer. It might be a little
	 * bit tedious, but it worth the price. The two following documents (hosted in this package and readable using the libreoffice software) 
	 * really well explain this concept :
	 * 
	 * - Java_is_still_free.odt
	 * - Zero_cost_java.odt
	 * 
	 * These files are here only for storing purposes and easy access in case of original sources become unavailable. There contents are respectively

	 * - https://blog.joda.org/2018/08/java-is-still-available-at-zero-cost.html
	 * 
	 * Don't hesitate to read them directly by going to this original links.
	 *
	 * As a conclusion, we need to note the following important thing : Be careful now of what implementation of java you will use. For example, 
	 * Oracle's implementation isn't free now for Production environment uses. You should consider others options, like openJdk binaries for 
	 * example, depending on what your needs are.
